### Beating haskell with C

An attemp to measure a simple, a multithreaded, and a unicode-aware version of
wc written in C compared with the optimized Haskell implementation in
[ChrisPenner/wc](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/wc).

I thought it wouldn't take much effort to make the C code win, but actually my
implementation loses!
